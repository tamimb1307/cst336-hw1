                    <b>Active Directory Information:</b><br /> 
                    <p> Active directory is a tool used by organizations to 
                    keep track of users, assign user permissions and roles, and act as 
                    a control center. Some branches would 
                    include active directory users and computers and active directory 
                    domain and trust. Automation is also performed for active directory.
                    This is a tool that is used as an industry 
                    standard for Windows based corporate environments. </p> <!-- paragraph -->
